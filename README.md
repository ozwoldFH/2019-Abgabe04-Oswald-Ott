# 2019-Abgabe04-Oswald-Ott
A repository for the exercise 04 in configuration management.

## Deepening overall revision

In this exercise we will consolidate and repeat the contents we have already
learned. The goals are summarized below as a task list and are similar to the 
goals in the previous exercises.

For some topics there are some extensions and offer a suitable deepening. The 
level of difficulty is higher because, for example, test methods are hardly 
predefined. Furthermore, many comments and other configuration management 
related content needs to be added.

This exercise serves to control the learned content and shows whether we can 
transfer our acquired knowledge to a software project. It also serves as a good
preparation for the upcoming exam.
